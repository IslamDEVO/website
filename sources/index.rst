Hi!
===

My name is Timoth√©e Mazzucotelli and you are here in the humble place where I write some thoughts and discoveries.
I live in France and currently work as a software engineer at IGBMC.
You can find me on GitHub under the username `Pawamoy <https://github.com/Pawamoy>`_.
I write my posts in reStructuredText and use Sphinx to generate the HTML pages. The pages are served by GitHub.
The theme is a fork of ReadTheDocs theme for Sphinx, more adapted for blogs (I guess?).
