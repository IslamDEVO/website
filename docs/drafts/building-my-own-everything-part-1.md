Where should I start?
I want to get some things done?
I want a personal assistant tailored to my needs and life-style?
I want to store everything I know and every file I have into a graph database?
I want a simple, cross-platform, online/offline todo list
in which I can queue items to review later?
I want a personal API on a personal server?
I want to automate a lot of things?
I want to make my computer do the hard work,
so I just have to decide when it cannot?

Yes. All of these. And more.

I have put back this project long enough.
I think I am finally ready to start tackling it.
