Write and use a Tox plugin within your package
==============================================

So let's say you wrote a program that is using tox and you want to add
some options to tox's command-line. Reading at `tox's
documentation <http://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html>`__
about plugins, you see that you have to make a pip installable plugin
and setup some entry point. In fact, you can skip the pip installable
side and integrate the plugin directly within your code.

It can be done in three very simple steps.

-  `Add a tox\_module in your
   package <#add-a-tox-module-in-your-package>`__
-  `Setup the entry points <#setup-the-entry-points>`__
-  `Update your code <#update-your-code>`__

Add a tox\_module in your package
---------------------------------

Create a new module somewhere. Its name should begin with ``tox_``.

.. code:: python

    # tox_your_module.py
    from tox import hookimpl


    @hookimpl
    def tox_addoption(parser):
        parser.add_argument('my_new_option')
        # read argparse's doc online to see more complex examples

Setup the entry points
----------------------

Tox has an automagic system that will see installed plugins and load
them when you call it. Just set the new ``tox`` entry point:

.. code:: python

    # setup.py
    setup(
        ...
        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': 'your_program = your_program.main:main',  # to be adapted
            'tox': ['your_module = your_program.tox_your_module']
        },
        ...
    )

Installing your package will make it visible to tox.

Update your code
----------------

In your code you will now be able to use the ``my_new_option`` option in
tox's config object, and do whatever you want with it!

.. code:: python

    from tox.session import prepare

    config = prepare(args)

    print(config.option.my_new_option)

Voil√†.

Of course your plugin could be much more complex, but this is another
story.
