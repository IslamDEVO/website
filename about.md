#### **NAME**
`pawamoy` — Timothée Mazzucotelli

#### **SYNOPSIS**
`pawamoy [GLOBAL_OPTS] COMMAND [COMMAND_OPTS] [OBJECT | IDEA]...`

#### **DESCRIPTION**
`pawamoy` lets you take control over the person identified by the name
*Timothée Mazzucotelli*.

Timothée Mazzucotelli was born in France and still lives there.
He received education in Computer Science and obtained
his Masters in C.S. in Université de Strasbourg.
He is therefore able to write code, amongst other things (see [COMMANDS](#commands)).

#### **GLOBAL OPTIONS**
These options influence how the command will be run. Please note that some switches
may not apply to some commands.

`--chatty`

<p class="i2"></p>
Increase verbosity. This flag is automatically switched on when command `drink`
is used with option `--alcohol`. Default: false.

`--enthusiast`

<p class="i2"></p>
This option is always useful, especially when learning new things.
Use it without caution!

`--fast`

<p class="i2"></p>
Do things fast. Behavior becomes non-deterministic: things will be done well
in average, but sometimes they will not. This option can yield more interesting
results though.

`--happy`

<p class="i2"></p>
Everyone wants to be happy right? Use this option regularly to ensure proper
sanity of mind.

`--introvert`

<p class="i2"></p>
Act with more reserve. Talk less. This option overrides and disables `--chatty`.
There is a high probability that `--over-thinking` will be switched on using
`--introvert`. This option can be used to avoid unnecessary jokes during professional
interactions, but try not to use it too much as it will reduce enthusiasm
and increase risk of switching `--shut` and `--silent` on.

`--open`

<p class="i2"></p>
Stay open! Every thing you hear or see will be received with more curiosity and enthusiasm.
Best used in combination with `learn` and `work` commands.

`--over-thinking`

<p class="i2"></p>
Spend more time thinking about things than actually doing them.

`--perfectionist`

<p class="i2"></p>
Nothing is ever good enough. Use this option to enable a
"constantly-improving-and-refactoring" behavior. Beware: time spent in this mode
is exponentially increased, and there are no guarantee of obtaining a final product!

`--reluctant`

<p class="i2"></p>
When inspiration is low, reluctant mode is activated. Things will be harder
at first, but once the machinery is warmed-up, this mode will be deactivated
and behavior will go back to normal.

`--safe`

<p class="i2"></p>
Sometimes things are dangerous. Use this mode to increase cautiousness and
avoid accidents.

`--silent`

<p class="i2"></p>
Do not say a word and be silent. This mode can be used to silently sneak behind
someone and surprise them. Be sure to know the person though. This mode is also
used at night, to avoid waking up the significant other.

`--slow`

<p class="i2"></p>
Side-effect of `--reluctant`, also triggered when tired. Everyone needs a bit
of slowness from time to time right?


#### **COMMANDS**
`code`

<p class="i2"></p>
Write or design code. It implies thinking, and can imply drawing. This command
can be run regularly, without moderation. It should not be used 100% of the time
though, because other vital tasks need attention.
